* What is a data race?

: Multiple goroutines access the same variable concurÂ­rently, and at least one of the accesses is a write.
: Can cause unexpected behaviour and/or incorrect data
: What about channels?
: Channels are good for communicating between goroutines
: We don't need to communicate between them
: We just want to make sure only one goroutine will update the map at any given time

* How do mutexes help?

: Allows "Locking" and "Unlocking"
: Multiple reads can occur
: Only one write can occur

* Adding a Mutex
.code datarace.go /^//MAPSTART/,/^//MAPEND/

* Time to code

: mutexes must not be copied, so if this struct is passed around, it should be done by pointer.
: note that the zero value of a mutex is usable as-is, so no initialization is required here.
